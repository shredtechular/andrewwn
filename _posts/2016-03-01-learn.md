My biggest project to date in which we constructed and maintained a very high profile and highly visited government website.  This is where I learned about agile development, continuous integration, and static site generators where we used Jekyll to develop the pages we needed and hosted them in Akamai.  This is the project I probably worked the hardest on, but gave me experience to eventually lead other developers on a team.
