This was a pretty small freelance job that I picked up which lead to bigger and better things for me. The client wanted this website to lookup availble toll free phone numbers from a vendor of his. The vendor made an API available for me to consume and display results based on if the user wanted some specific words in the toll free number (a.k.a. - vanity toll free number).
