This was one of the first freelance jobs that I piced up in my spare time. I submitted a proposal to work on it through a freelancing website called eLance.com. The client was looking for a programmer to make several updates to his website, including a notification system for when their offices would be closed and some forms to dynamically convert to pdfs.
