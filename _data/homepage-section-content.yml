Most of the work I have done has been built for internal business and government use only, so it is not possible to release the full blown applications.

I moved from Virginia to Baltimore and switched to Aquilent where I worked until 2016. If you add it all up it equals over 15 years of on the job experience and 20 years of developing!"

A collaborative leader who is particularly skilled in architecting databases and developing the user interface to meet the stated requirements.  A gifted and agile learner as evidenced by quickly adapting to other skills such as project management and network administration.<br/><br/>Snowboarding is my favorite non-technical hobby, so that will explain why I decided to combine some aspects of a couple of activities that I do well!"
